# Pubmed Source Record

This loader adds the pubmed source record, which is required in order for the Pubmed importer
to work. The pubmed source record is normally added as part of either of the PMC loaders.
This loader does not require any external data.

```bash
node bin/load.js api pubmed_source
```
