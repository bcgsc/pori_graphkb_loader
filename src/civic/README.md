# CIViC

> :warning: Since this loader produces statements, ontology and vocabulary data should be loaded first

Loads statements into GraphKB using the [CIViC](https://civicdb.org/) REST API.

```bash
node bin/load.js civic
```

## About

The `variant.js` module handles all parsing/processing of variant records in CIViC for entry into GraphKB. The corresponding tests are under `test/civic.test.js`.

In general this loader attempts to update existing records based on their CIViC evidence ID, however when the mapping from CIViC evidence record to GraphKB statement is not 1 to 1 then the statement is sometimes recreated and the old version soft-deleted instead since we cannot resolve tracking between the 2 for these cases.

### Trusted Curators

By default this loader only loads accepted (reviewed and approved) evidence items from CIViC. However, sometimes items can take a while to be reviewed. To mitigate this problem we allow a list of "trusted curators" for which we can load statements in the submitted state. These will be loaded with a GraphKB status of "pending". The IDs that should be passed are the CIViC user IDs. For example

```bash
node bin/load.js civic --trustedCurators 123 124
```
